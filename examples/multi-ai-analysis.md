**User goal:** Understand pros/cons of a proposed trucking safety regulation.

Agents:

- ChatGPT – general explanation & structure
- Claude – deep analysis, edge cases
- Grok – adversarial / contrarian critique
- Perplexity – citations & external sources

BORG sends the same question to all four, then asks Claude to synthesize and Grok to attack the synthesis.

This file will eventually contain a real transcript once BORG has a working prototype.
