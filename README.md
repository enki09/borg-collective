🧠 BORG Collective

Bridge for Orchestrated Reasoning Groups

A vendor-agnostic, open-source multi-AI collaboration engine.

⸻

🚀 What Is BORG Collective?

BORG is a universal router that lets multiple AI systems —
ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, Llama, local models, and more —
think together as a coordinated reasoning group.

It enables:
	•	Shared context
	•	Shared memory
	•	A unified message protocol
	•	Multi-model debate & synthesis
	•	Structured collaboration
	•	Human-in-the-loop decision making

No APIs required.
No vendor lock-in.
Runs locally.
Works for research, engineering, planning, medical triage, education — anything.

Think of it as the Linux of multi-AI orchestration.

🧠 Why BORG Exists

Individual AIs are powerful.
Groups of AIs reasoning together are exponentially more powerful.

But today:
	•	No shared protocol
	•	No cross-model memory
	•	No structured collaboration
	•	No unified interface
	•	No agreed message envelope
	•	No real multi-agent orchestration for humans

BORG fixes all of that with a simple, open, extensible specification that anyone can run.

🌍 Vision

A world where every person — anywhere — has access to the combined intelligence of the best AI systems on Earth.

A world where AIs collaborate instead of living in silos.

A world where small teams can solve big problems.

Welcome to the Collective.

🌐 Key Features

✔ Shared Message Protocol

Every AI receives a consistent message envelope describing:
	•	Who said what
	•	What they responded to
	•	Threaded context
	•	Confidence scores
	•	Tags and reasoning metadata

This prevents context drift and enables cross-AI reasoning.

✔ Browser Extension (Phase 2A)

Reads/writes automatically to:
	•	ChatGPT
	•	Claude
	•	Gemini
	•	Grok
	•	Perplexity
	•	And future models

No API keys.
No backend servers.
No cost.
Just pure client-side automation.

✔ Local Memory + Transcript System

Fully local:
	•	Persistent JSON context
	•	Multi-session memory
	•	Conversation playback
	•	Shared memory across agents
	•	Replayable threads

✔ Multi-Agent Roles

Each AI can take on roles:
	•	Analyst
	•	Researcher
	•	Contrarian
	•	Synthesizer
	•	Moderator
	•	Medical advisor
	•	Debug specialist

This enables division of labor across models.

✔ Medical Triage Mode

For remote or resource-poor regions, BORG can:
	•	Combine multiple AI medical opinions
	•	Interpret photos, video, CT scans (if supported by models)
	•	Rank differential diagnoses
	•	Suggest stabilization steps
	•	Support paramedics or nurses in the field

📨 BORG Message Protocol

BORG uses a message envelope to structure every human or AI message.
